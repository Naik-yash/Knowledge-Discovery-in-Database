Consider the data in Table above (end of chapter 6 or 8). The target variable is salary. Start by discretizing salary and age as follows: Less than $35,000                      Level 1 $35,000 to less than $45,000   Level 2  $45,000 to less than $55,000   Level 3  Above $55,000                             Level 40   – 30                                               <= 3031 - 40                                               <= 40Above 40                                           <= 505.1 Construct a classification and regression tree to classify salary based on the other variables only one split level.Hint: you may want to set up the excel file like the followingSplitPLPRLevelP( j |tL )P( j |tR)2PL PRQ(s|t)Φ(s|t)10.2730.727L10.3330.1250.3970.5830.231L20.3330.250L30.3330.375L40.0000.25025.
