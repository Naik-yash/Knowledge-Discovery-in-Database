Load the “breast-cancer-wisconsin.data.csv” from canvas into R and perform the EDA analysis by:
Summarizing each column (e.g. min, max, mean 
Identifying missing values
Replacing the missing values with the “mean” of the column
Displaying the frequency table of “Class” vs. F6V.Displaying the scatter plot of F1 to F6, one pair at a time
Show histogram box plot for columns F7 to F9

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
Breast_cancer <- read.csv('/Users/yash/downloads/breast-cancer-wisconsin.data.csv')
Breast_cancer1 <- read.csv('/Users/yash/downloads/breast-cancer-wisconsin.data.csv',header=TRUE,na.strings=c("","?","NA"))

colSums(is.na(Breast_cancer1))

min <- apply(Breast_cancer1,2,min,na.rm = TRUE)
min
max <- apply(Breast_cancer1,2,max,na.rm = TRUE)
max
mean <- apply(Breast_cancer1,2,mean,na.rm = TRUE)
mean

summary (Breast_cancer1, na.rm= TRUE)

Mean_f6 <- colMeans(Breast_cancer1, na.rm=TRUE)
index <- which(is.na(Breast_cancer1), arr.ind=TRUE)
index
Breast_cancer1[index] <- Mean_f6[index[,2]]
levels(Breast_cancer1$f6)

attach(Breast_cancer1)
table<-table(F6,Class)

margin.table(table,1)
margin.table(table,2)
prop.table(table) 
prop.table(table, 1)  
prop.table(table, 2)

plot(Breast_cancer1[,2:7])
boxplot(Breast_cancer1[,8:10], horizontal=FALSE, axes= TRUE)


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
